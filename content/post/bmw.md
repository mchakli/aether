In January, leading Turkish broadcasters worked with Admongrel to deliver an Addressable TV project for Borusan Otomotiv. The campaign saw 63% increase in response rates and enabled the company to collect detailed customer information directly from the TV screen. Delivering the content without degrading the viewer experience was key to the success of the campaign.

A great example of the future of TV advertising, linking the big screen to mobile and desktop activity.
By providing the infrastructure for the project and working with its Broadcast partners,  Admongrel was able to optimize delivery of the campaign to the TV screens in a smooth and consistent manner, without interfering with the viewing experience.

During the  campaign viewers were asked to share their mobile numbers. Subsequently they were called by their local BMW sales center to organize test drives and follow up.

Admongrel is a technology led innovative addressable TV business, to date we have delivered over 50  measurable and targeted campaigns in over 20 territories.
